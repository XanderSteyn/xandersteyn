<img src="IGNORE/Headers/About Me.svg" alt="About Me"/><br>

I've been programming for over 6 years. I started out in ethical hacking and cybersecurity, but moved into software engineering in early 2025. That background still shapes how I work ~ I care about secure design, clean structure, and building things that hold up over time.

Outside of coding, I play piano by ear ~ fast, emotional pieces that help me clear my mind. I've recently started composing my own music, which feels like a way to translate my thoughts into sound. I find peace in quiet moments spent outdoors, using the time to think through ideas. Painting is next on my list, a new way to bring ideas to life beyond code and music.
